I went out for a cup of tea and when I came back I thought, It is a good time to reply to one of my friends on Discord and as soon as I touch the mouse. The line started to appear. For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed. I updated drivers and downgraded to the drivers that was provided in the CD but no luck. Did some online research and someone said to uninstall every drivers and install it. Did that and still no luck. Installed a new windows and still no luck. I took out the graphic card and started the computer normally on Intel graphics and it was working fine. At that point I was convinced that nothing was wrong with my monitor nor it is with the Windows or my motherboard. Something is definitely wrong with the GPU. I contacted Amazon and this is the best part. The worst support I ever got. First of all, the guy I was talking to, His name was Amit and he took like 2 minutes to reply to my questions regarding the replacement. Then he comes up with an excuse stating that he is busy with Multiple customer on the chat support. I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center. They told me it will take at least a week for it to be replaced. Now here I am waiting on my butt for something I paid that should be working fine in the first place just for it to stop working 15 days later. If you are looking for a budget GPU for gaming then I would recommend GTX 1650 Super. You can go on YouTube and see the comparison and decide for yourself.

For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed.

I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center.

I went out for a cup of tea and when I came back I thought, It is a good time to reply to one of my friends on Discord and as soon as I touch the mouse. The line started to appear. For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed. I updated drivers and downgraded to the drivers that was provided in the CD but no luck. Did some online research and someone said to uninstall every drivers and install it. Did that and still no luck. Installed a new windows and still no luck. I took out the graphic card and started the computer normally on Intel graphics and it was working fine. At that point I was convinced that nothing was wrong with my monitor nor it is with the Windows or my motherboard. Something is definitely wrong with the GPU. I contacted Amazon and this is the best part. The worst support I ever got. First of all, the guy I was talking to, His name was Amit and he took like 2 minutes to reply to my questions regarding the replacement. Then he comes up with an excuse stating that he is busy with Multiple customer on the chat support. I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center. They told me it will take at least a week for it to be replaced. Now here I am waiting on my butt for something I paid that should be working fine in the first place just for it to stop working 15 days later. If you are looking for a budget GPU for gaming then I would recommend GTX 1650 Super. You can go on YouTube and see the comparison and decide for yourself.

For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed.

I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center.

I went out for a cup of tea and when I came back I thought, It is a good time to reply to one of my friends on Discord and as soon as I touch the mouse. The line started to appear. For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed. I updated drivers and downgraded to the drivers that was provided in the CD but no luck. Did some online research and someone said to uninstall every drivers and install it. Did that and still no luck. Installed a new windows and still no luck. I took out the graphic card and started the computer normally on Intel graphics and it was working fine. At that point I was convinced that nothing was wrong with my monitor nor it is with the Windows or my motherboard. Something is definitely wrong with the GPU. I contacted Amazon and this is the best part. The worst support I ever got. First of all, the guy I was talking to, His name was Amit and he took like 2 minutes to reply to my questions regarding the replacement. Then he comes up with an excuse stating that he is busy with Multiple customer on the chat support. I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center. They told me it will take at least a week for it to be replaced. Now here I am waiting on my butt for something I paid that should be working fine in the first place just for it to stop working 15 days later. If you are looking for a budget GPU for gaming then I would recommend GTX 1650 Super. You can go on YouTube and see the comparison and decide for yourself.

For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed.

I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center.

I went out for a cup of tea and when I came back I thought, It is a good time to reply to one of my friends on Discord and as soon as I touch the mouse. The line started to appear. For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed. I updated drivers and downgraded to the drivers that was provided in the CD but no luck. Did some online research and someone said to uninstall every drivers and install it. Did that and still no luck. Installed a new windows and still no luck. I took out the graphic card and started the computer normally on Intel graphics and it was working fine. At that point I was convinced that nothing was wrong with my monitor nor it is with the Windows or my motherboard. Something is definitely wrong with the GPU. I contacted Amazon and this is the best part. The worst support I ever got. First of all, the guy I was talking to, His name was Amit and he took like 2 minutes to reply to my questions regarding the replacement. Then he comes up with an excuse stating that he is busy with Multiple customer on the chat support. I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center. They told me it will take at least a week for it to be replaced. Now here I am waiting on my butt for something I paid that should be working fine in the first place just for it to stop working 15 days later. If you are looking for a budget GPU for gaming then I would recommend GTX 1650 Super. You can go on YouTube and see the comparison and decide for yourself.

For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed.

I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center.

I went out for a cup of tea and when I came back I thought, It is a good time to reply to one of my friends on Discord and as soon as I touch the mouse. The line started to appear. For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed. I updated drivers and downgraded to the drivers that was provided in the CD but no luck. Did some online research and someone said to uninstall every drivers and install it. Did that and still no luck. Installed a new windows and still no luck. I took out the graphic card and started the computer normally on Intel graphics and it was working fine. At that point I was convinced that nothing was wrong with my monitor nor it is with the Windows or my motherboard. Something is definitely wrong with the GPU. I contacted Amazon and this is the best part. The worst support I ever got. First of all, the guy I was talking to, His name was Amit and he took like 2 minutes to reply to my questions regarding the replacement. Then he comes up with an excuse stating that he is busy with Multiple customer on the chat support. I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center. They told me it will take at least a week for it to be replaced. Now here I am waiting on my butt for something I paid that should be working fine in the first place just for it to stop working 15 days later. If you are looking for a budget GPU for gaming then I would recommend GTX 1650 Super. You can go on YouTube and see the comparison and decide for yourself.

For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed.

I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center.

I went out for a cup of tea and when I came back I thought, It is a good time to reply to one of my friends on Discord and as soon as I touch the mouse. The line started to appear. For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed. I updated drivers and downgraded to the drivers that was provided in the CD but no luck. Did some online research and someone said to uninstall every drivers and install it. Did that and still no luck. Installed a new windows and still no luck. I took out the graphic card and started the computer normally on Intel graphics and it was working fine. At that point I was convinced that nothing was wrong with my monitor nor it is with the Windows or my motherboard. Something is definitely wrong with the GPU. I contacted Amazon and this is the best part. The worst support I ever got. First of all, the guy I was talking to, His name was Amit and he took like 2 minutes to reply to my questions regarding the replacement. Then he comes up with an excuse stating that he is busy with Multiple customer on the chat support. I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center. They told me it will take at least a week for it to be replaced. Now here I am waiting on my butt for something I paid that should be working fine in the first place just for it to stop working 15 days later. If you are looking for a budget GPU for gaming then I would recommend GTX 1650 Super. You can go on YouTube and see the comparison and decide for yourself.

For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed.

I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center.

I went out for a cup of tea and when I came back I thought, It is a good time to reply to one of my friends on Discord and as soon as I touch the mouse. The line started to appear. For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed. I updated drivers and downgraded to the drivers that was provided in the CD but no luck. Did some online research and someone said to uninstall every drivers and install it. Did that and still no luck. Installed a new windows and still no luck. I took out the graphic card and started the computer normally on Intel graphics and it was working fine. At that point I was convinced that nothing was wrong with my monitor nor it is with the Windows or my motherboard. Something is definitely wrong with the GPU. I contacted Amazon and this is the best part. The worst support I ever got. First of all, the guy I was talking to, His name was Amit and he took like 2 minutes to reply to my questions regarding the replacement. Then he comes up with an excuse stating that he is busy with Multiple customer on the chat support. I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center. They told me it will take at least a week for it to be replaced. Now here I am waiting on my butt for something I paid that should be working fine in the first place just for it to stop working 15 days later. If you are looking for a budget GPU for gaming then I would recommend GTX 1650 Super. You can go on YouTube and see the comparison and decide for yourself.

For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed.

I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center.

I went out for a cup of tea and when I came back I thought, It is a good time to reply to one of my friends on Discord and as soon as I touch the mouse. The line started to appear. For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed. I updated drivers and downgraded to the drivers that was provided in the CD but no luck. Did some online research and someone said to uninstall every drivers and install it. Did that and still no luck. Installed a new windows and still no luck. I took out the graphic card and started the computer normally on Intel graphics and it was working fine. At that point I was convinced that nothing was wrong with my monitor nor it is with the Windows or my motherboard. Something is definitely wrong with the GPU. I contacted Amazon and this is the best part. The worst support I ever got. First of all, the guy I was talking to, His name was Amit and he took like 2 minutes to reply to my questions regarding the replacement. Then he comes up with an excuse stating that he is busy with Multiple customer on the chat support. I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center. They told me it will take at least a week for it to be replaced. Now here I am waiting on my butt for something I paid that should be working fine in the first place just for it to stop working 15 days later. If you are looking for a budget GPU for gaming then I would recommend GTX 1650 Super. You can go on YouTube and see the comparison and decide for yourself.

For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed.

I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center.

I went out for a cup of tea and when I came back I thought, It is a good time to reply to one of my friends on Discord and as soon as I touch the mouse. The line started to appear. For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed. I updated drivers and downgraded to the drivers that was provided in the CD but no luck. Did some online research and someone said to uninstall every drivers and install it. Did that and still no luck. Installed a new windows and still no luck. I took out the graphic card and started the computer normally on Intel graphics and it was working fine. At that point I was convinced that nothing was wrong with my monitor nor it is with the Windows or my motherboard. Something is definitely wrong with the GPU. I contacted Amazon and this is the best part. The worst support I ever got. First of all, the guy I was talking to, His name was Amit and he took like 2 minutes to reply to my questions regarding the replacement. Then he comes up with an excuse stating that he is busy with Multiple customer on the chat support. I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center. They told me it will take at least a week for it to be replaced. Now here I am waiting on my butt for something I paid that should be working fine in the first place just for it to stop working 15 days later. If you are looking for a budget GPU for gaming then I would recommend GTX 1650 Super. You can go on YouTube and see the comparison and decide for yourself.

For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed.

I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center.

I went out for a cup of tea and when I came back I thought, It is a good time to reply to one of my friends on Discord and as soon as I touch the mouse. The line started to appear. For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed. I updated drivers and downgraded to the drivers that was provided in the CD but no luck. Did some online research and someone said to uninstall every drivers and install it. Did that and still no luck. Installed a new windows and still no luck. I took out the graphic card and started the computer normally on Intel graphics and it was working fine. At that point I was convinced that nothing was wrong with my monitor nor it is with the Windows or my motherboard. Something is definitely wrong with the GPU. I contacted Amazon and this is the best part. The worst support I ever got. First of all, the guy I was talking to, His name was Amit and he took like 2 minutes to reply to my questions regarding the replacement. Then he comes up with an excuse stating that he is busy with Multiple customer on the chat support. I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center. They told me it will take at least a week for it to be replaced. Now here I am waiting on my butt for something I paid that should be working fine in the first place just for it to stop working 15 days later. If you are looking for a budget GPU for gaming then I would recommend GTX 1650 Super. You can go on YouTube and see the comparison and decide for yourself.

For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed.

I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center.

I went out for a cup of tea and when I came back I thought, It is a good time to reply to one of my friends on Discord and as soon as I touch the mouse. The line started to appear. For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed. I updated drivers and downgraded to the drivers that was provided in the CD but no luck. Did some online research and someone said to uninstall every drivers and install it. Did that and still no luck. Installed a new windows and still no luck. I took out the graphic card and started the computer normally on Intel graphics and it was working fine. At that point I was convinced that nothing was wrong with my monitor nor it is with the Windows or my motherboard. Something is definitely wrong with the GPU. I contacted Amazon and this is the best part. The worst support I ever got. First of all, the guy I was talking to, His name was Amit and he took like 2 minutes to reply to my questions regarding the replacement. Then he comes up with an excuse stating that he is busy with Multiple customer on the chat support. I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center. They told me it will take at least a week for it to be replaced. Now here I am waiting on my butt for something I paid that should be working fine in the first place just for it to stop working 15 days later. If you are looking for a budget GPU for gaming then I would recommend GTX 1650 Super. You can go on YouTube and see the comparison and decide for yourself.

It was good but what I did not like was that, Not even a month and the GPU had gone to crap. I went out for a cup of tea and when I came back I thought, It is a good time to reply to one of my friends on Discord and as soon as I touch the mouse. The line started to appear. For a second I went into a suspense mode thinking my monitor had gone bad but it turned out the GPU started to sh*t the bed. I updated drivers and downgraded to the drivers that was provided in the CD but no luck. Did some online research and someone said to uninstall every drivers and install it. Did that and still no luck. Installed a new windows and still no luck. I took out the graphic card and started the computer normally on Intel graphics and it was working fine. At that point I was convinced that nothing was wrong with my monitor nor it is with the Windows or my motherboard. Something is definitely wrong with the GPU. I contacted Amazon and this is the best part. The worst support I ever got. First of all, the guy I was talking to, His name was Amit and he took like 2 minutes to reply to my questions regarding the replacement. Then he comes up with an excuse stating that he is busy with Multiple customer on the chat support. I know multiple chat support is hard but I have worked for Microsoft Chat support and I handled multiple chats at the same time and all you have to do is copy and paste the words that you already have in your text pad or whatever they have there. I asked the guy for a replacement and my return time but I got no response until minutes later. He said that return cannot be done because only 10 days is provided for you to make a return. My question to Amazon support is why do you guys have 10 days return policy instead of 30 days? I mean, I am buying an expensive product and what if the product turns out to be faulty. At least it would be easier for me to return it to the place from where it came from and get a new one within those 30 days but no luck and the guy who I was taking too, Took so long to reply. He just mentioned to contact ASUS and that is what I did. Now I called ASUS tech support and they told me to take it to the service center. They told me it will take at least a week for it to be replaced.
